Other level ideas:

* [DAY OF INDEPENDENCE] Office highrise being attacked by an alien mothership's tractor beam.  You start at the top floor of the building, mothership arrives and blasts a huge beam down onto the building.  The beam causes blocks to float upwards so it eats away layers of the building from the top down.  You have to dig down through the levels of the building until you can escape.  Open spaces are rectangular and regularly placed, but there's chairs, desks and file cabinets scattered everywhere. Beam covers the sides of the building, so you can't escape sideways either.  Would need chair, desk, file cabinate, concrete, and beam tiles I think.

* [BEADS? HOW HARD CAN IT BE...? BEES!] Walking on grass when it gives way and the player finds himself inside the top levels of a giant bee hive. Angry giant bees spawn occasionally behind the player at certain visible spawn squares [<.>] maybe a bee head poking out of a hexagon or something.  Get to the bottom to the queen's chamber and ride her to safety. Would need lots of hexagon tiles, pools of honey, giant queen, etc.  Could make for interesting level design.  Would need some sort of epilogue (you win) screen I think, like maybe the dude blasting off to safety on the back of the queen, or holding her hostage until he died of starvation or something, or them falling in love and living together forever (like an epilogue).  Alternately could actually animate the queen blasting off upward through the level with him on her back.

* i was thinking another thing you could do is give him the ability to swim and have a level with water coming down he could swim for a short while until he runs out of air.
  * submarine level?
  * sunken building with water sections?
  *

* maybe have some temporary suits he could wear... like a scuba suit, a bee suit, a lava suit?
* bees would be just like water except he can't swim without a bee suit swimming through BEES
* or maybe they just allow him to stand still without getting stung
